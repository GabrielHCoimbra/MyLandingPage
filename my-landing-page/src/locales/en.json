    "description": "I'm a lifelong learner, fascinated by learning and personal growth. Beyond technology, I'm interested in all subjects surrounding society, with particular emphasis on economics, sociology, and philosophy. I completed technical web development training at SENAI in 2022, but after finishing the course, I stepped away from the IT field due to my interests in economics. However, in 2025, I looked at the IT market with fresh eyes and a new perspective. Now more experienced and knowledgeable about the diverse opportunities in the sector, I returned to fullstack development learning and began my training with a focus on specializing in Business Intelligence & Machine Learning development.",
